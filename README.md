# Ehler's-Danlos Community Site
 
 This project is the beginning of a social site for those affected by Ehler's-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). It is a place to find community and discuss living with various types of EDS. People will be able to discuss difficulties with EDS and hopefully be able to connect with others who are dealing with the same issues- and possibly provide some solutions. EDS is not well-diagnosed, and there is little medical treatment available. Many of us have found solutions on our own to help navigate our daily lives- this is a place to share that advice!
 
 ## What is Ehler's-Danlos?
 Ehler's-Danlos Syndrome is a family of genetic conditions that causes abnormalities in connective tissue throughout the body. There are many types of EDS, and it can be difficult to diagnose. Receiving approval for genetic testing can be difficult to impossible- and the most common type, the hypermobile variant, does not yet have a found genetic sequence.
 
 ## About the Author
 
  I'm a new front-end focused developer who is looking to maintain my skills and build new ones- all while starting a passion project that's close to my heart.
 
 Hi, I'm Elliot, and I have hypermobile Ehler's-Danlos Syndrome. I was diagnosed in 2023 when I was 28 years old. This came after a lifetime of injuries and constant pain, and very little help from doctors on managing that pain or my mystery injuries. Even with a diagnosis, most of my doctors are confused when I mention EDS- they don't know much or anything about it.
 
 I recently completed a bootcamp for web development, so I decided to build a site that would help myself and so many others like me. Sharing life stories about injuries, pain, medical gaslighting, braces and mobility aids, and so on. It will also be a place for people with EDS to share solutions that worked for them- how to get comfortable (enough) to sleep, reliable joint braces, employment with EDS, and more!
